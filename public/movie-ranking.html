					<h3>Reminiscence</h3>
					<p>I believe pop culture at large have avoided any mention of the Hugh Jackman-starring film entirely but am welcomed to be proven
					wrong otherwise. The film portrays a future where we are able to relive our most memorable moments, moments that are ever lived once,
					over again and as many times as desired. The technology then becomes a double-edged sword and a last resort as the protagonatist hunts
					down a woman as the key to free him from his derelict past. In spite of the film being a COVID-era film, you'll feel the connection the film captures.</p>

					<h3>Ford v. Ferrari</h3>
					<p>It is a quite older film to recommend but it definitely garnered the attention of both motorsport enthusiasts and movie-goers alike.
					It is the Hollywood take on the legacy of Shelby-American legend, Ken Miles. The film itself is not a biography per se, but recounts the
					events leading to Ken Miles driving for Ford Motor Co.. With Carroll Shelby having to conform to the company man etiquette, Ford
					seek to rival Ferrari in one of the biggest racing events of its time, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Even as an unaware and clueless racing fan
					or petrolhead, Christian Bale's delivery of Ken Miles will surely keep you staring throughout. It's why I recommend it. Great acting. Thrilling scenes.</p>

					<h3>Ghost In The Shell</h3>
					<p>My last choice is another film that gained some buzz in popular media and went on deaf ears  after it's debut in theaters. The flim
					is based on the japanese anime and manga series of the same name by Masamune Shirow, and stars popular actress, Scarlett Johansson
					as the Major of secret operations terrorist squad, Section 9. Interestingly, the film follows similar plot sequences to the release of the 1995-
					animated film. However, the plot for both films are not equal. Uniquely, the film recaptures the same theme of "freedom without liberty"
					and corruption that would be seen in the animes and mangas, except the film is quite a bite-sized version. I do recommend watching the
					film because well it has Scarlett Johansson and it is action-packed. No cheap thrills here but lots of boom. Just do not expect a profounding
					plot when watching the film. Afterwards, consider exploring the animes if you liked the theme of the GitS film.</p>
